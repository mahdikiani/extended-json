# extended-json
This Python package provides an extended JSON encoder class, `JSONSerializer`, that enables encoding of complex Python data types such as `datetime.datetime`, `datetime.date`, `datetime.time`, `bytes` and `uuid`. It also supports objects that have a `to_json` method, allowing for customizable JSON encoding.
